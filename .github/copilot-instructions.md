- Apply Clean Code™️.
- Avoid duplicate code.
- Avoid redundant variables: don't create temporary variables that simply rename another value unless it improves readability or documents intent.
- Prefer direct returns, destructuring, and small helper functions.
- If a variable adds clarity, name it descriptively and keep its scope minimal.
- Files should never be longer than 100 lines.
- Methods should never be longer than 10 lines.
- Never use `eslint-disable` or `/* eslint-disable */` comments to silence linter errors; instead fix the underlying issue.
- No README or documentation needed.
- No jsdoc. No comments needed. Code explains itself.
- Prefer composition to inheritance.
- Use constants for fixed values instead of magic numbers or strings.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Avoid side effects in functions. Write pure functions whenever possible.
- No unused code. No unused variables, functions, imports, or exports.
- Compile after each change.
- After making any code change, increment the patch version in `src/version.ts` (e.g., 0.0.1 → 0.0.2).
